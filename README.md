## Project Description

The Coingecko Search Input project is a web application that allows users to search for coin names using a search input. As the user types, the application dynamically fetches coin data from the Coingecko API and displays matching coin names along with their logos. When a user clicks on a coin name from the dropdown, the application updates to show the selected coin's name and logo.
